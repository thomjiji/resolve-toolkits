"""
Fetch DaVinci Resolve project unique IDs (by simply opening every project and close it
immediately to retrieve its unique ID) and save to CSV.

Notice:
1. Since we need to open each project, so it's really slow...
2. User should enter the correspond folder that this script should iterate over
   manually. If not, script will start from the root folder.
3. Legacy projects may encounter error (such like plugin non-available, DCTL missing,
   etc), user should notice and click the popup window to let it go.
